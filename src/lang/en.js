    "lang4":"HyperDAO is a decentralized IDO platform built on the Polygon network (MATIC). HyperDAO helps the best crypto projects to launch their tokens and provide them with initial liquidity through our extensive customer base. As an experienced blockchain incubator, HyperDAO provides their users with investment opportunities in several high quality blockchain projects. HyperDAO also ensures that the barriers to entry are low so that everyone will be able to participate. Users of the platform will also be able to earn passive income via staking even if they choose not to participate in any project launches.",
    "lang5":"Users can stake HDAO tokens into the smart contract to become a member of the platform. Through staking, users will be entitled to staking rewards and mining rewards; these tokens can also be unstaked at any point in time. ",
    "lang6":"HyperDAO's membership system consists of four tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Each tier has a different staking requirement. Higher tiered member will be able to purchase more project tokens; however, HyperDAO ensures that every tier has a minimum weightage and right to new launches, every participant, no matter the tier, will be able to receive an allocation.

After the pre-allocation, individual weights are calculated and participants will be notified regarding the amount of tokens they can purchase.",
    "lang18":"Claim stage: Once the pre-allocation stage ends, participants are required to claim their allocated shares within a certain time interval. If USDTs paid in the previous stage exceeds individual allocation quota limits, the portion over the limit will be returned automatically. If there are still tokens remaining after the first round, a second round (First Come First Serve or FCFS) will be activated. ",
